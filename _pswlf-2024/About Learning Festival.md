<p>Public Service Learning Festival (PSWLF) is an annual learning event as
part of the Public Service Week 2024 (PSW2024). This year PSWLF is redesi!gned
to be focused and compact, with an emphasis to encourage public officers
to take charge of their development. Topics such as competency-driven growth
(CDG) and upskilling in sunrise areas will permeate through the various
sessions. The experience will be curated to benefit all public officers,
with special attention to specific groups of officers (i.e., policy officers,
support officers, officers in specific job families) to support their growth
and career development.</p>
