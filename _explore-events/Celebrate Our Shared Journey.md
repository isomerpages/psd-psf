<p>Singapore’s Public Service has been quietly transforming the way officers
work, serve, and solve problems, keeping pace with a nation that is growing
more complex by the day.</p>
<p>While most of us go about our daily routines, public agencies have been
reimagining the fundamentals: from building homes faster and smarter, to
improving how we communicate with citizens, and ensuring the Public Service
remains innovative and agile. Read on to learn about 11 practical solutions
that made Singapore a better place!</p>
<h4>Building faster, smarter homes</h4>
<p><em>The challenge:</em> As Singapore’s largest housing developer, the Housing
and Development Board (HDB) faces the challenge of meeting the fast-growing
demand for homes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The solution</em>: The game-changer? <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/our-role/smart-and-sustainable-living/innovations/precast-technology-page" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Precast technology</u></a>.
Since the 1980s, HDB has been building smarter by manufacturing components
off-site and assembling them on location. This improves quality, makes
worksites safer, reduces reliance on manual labour, and cuts down on noise,
dust, and construction waste. Today, about <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/about-us/research-and-innovation/construction-productivity/prefabrication-technology" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>70% of structural concrete</u></a> in
HDB projects is precast, contributing to a productivity boost of <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/-/media/doc/SCEG/11102022_Annex.ashx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>over 25%!</u></a>
